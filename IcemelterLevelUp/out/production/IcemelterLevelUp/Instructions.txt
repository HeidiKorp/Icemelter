Story

One day in the winter, when You went skiing in the mountains, you suddenly
fell into a deep ice cave. When You woke up, you noticed that there was
only ice above you and no other way out. Luckily, You have a magical
fireball that could melt all the ice and break You free! But be aware -
if you drop the ball, the ice below You will melt and You will drop even
further until the ball won't reach the top and You will be imprisoned
in the cave forever.

Instructions

Use Your mouse to move the paddle and melt all ice blocks. You have
three lives. If you drop the ball, you will lose one life. Melting
one block equals 5 points. After losing the game, press
ENTER to play again. To pause the game, press SPACE.
